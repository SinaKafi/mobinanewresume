                The Tractor fan app was designed as an extension of the Tractor
                website, created to provide fans with convenient, real-time
                access to news, updates, and activities related to their
                favorite team. The app aimed to simplify and enhance the fan
                experience, ensuring a seamless connection between users and the
                team they love. Its development was centered around creating a
                user-friendly platform that addressed practical needs while

                Through research and user feedback analysis, I identified pain

                quickly and effortlessly buy tickets without frustration,
                improving their overall experience.   <br />
                In addition to ticketing, I focused on designing features to
                deliver real-time match updates, enabling fans to stay informed
                during games. To enhance user engagement, I introduced
                interactive elements such as polls, game highlights, and fan
                forums, transforming the app into a dynamic space where fans
                could actively participate and share their enthusiasm.

                among fans, making them feel like an integral part of the team’s
                journey. By bridging the gap between the team and its

                Design Process for Nami Khodro Website:
                <br />
                The design process for the Nami Khodro website, an e-commerce
                platform for selling Toyota cars in Iran, followed a structured
                approach that included several key stages: research, user
                experience (UX) design, user interface (UI) design, and
                implementation of technical features. The main objective was to
                ensure an easy, intuitive, and secure online car shopping
                experience, while also enhancing the brand presence of both
                Toyota and Nami Khodro.

                  <p className="leading-7 text-lg whitespace-normal text-justify font-light">
                    The first step in the design process was meeting with Nami
                    Khodro to clearly understand their requirements. They wanted
                    a website that displayed Toyota vehicles available for sale
                    in Iran, complete with detailed specifications, pricing, and
                    availability dates. In addition, they requested an
                    electronic contract system to simplify and secure the
                    purchase process. We also conducted competitor research to
                    understand the best practices in the automotive e-commerce
                    space.

                    The goal during the UX design phase was to create a seamless

                    desired Toyota vehicle with minimal friction.

                        completing a purchase. This helped us identify key

                        Using wireframing tools, we mapped out the layout of

                        “Add to Cart” and “Request a Quote.” We also created
                        prototypes to test the flow of the website before moving

                <br /> One of my clients reached out to me with a project idea
                focused on employee wellness in the workplace. The goal was to
                create an app that would allow employees to easily address any
                physical or mental health issues they might encounter during
                their workday. The app needed to enable users to request
                counseling, report feelings of depression, resolve conflicts
                with colleagues, or even request a doctor's visit for any
                physical ailments—simply by uploading medical records and
                requesting a consultation.
